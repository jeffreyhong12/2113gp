If this Pokémon on the field dies, the next one will be replaced automatically.

Each Pokémon has two types of attacks, normal attacks and skill attacks. Normal attacks cause more damage, skill attacks cause less damage but will have special effects.

There are currently two special effects, burning and stunned. If the enemy is hit by the burning effect, he will take some damage at the beginning of the next turn. If the enemy is stunned, there is a certain chance that he will be unable to act in the next turn.

Each Pokémon has seven different attributes, namely: HP, attack, defense, skill, skill_effect, skill_level, skill_attact
